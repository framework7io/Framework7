# How to contribute

Framework7 loves to welcome your contributions. There are several ways to help out:

* Create an [issue](https://github.com/framework7io/framework7/issues) on GitHub, if you have found a bug
* Write test cases or provide examples for open bug issues
* Write patches for open bug/feature issues

There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we have a
chance of keeping on top of things.


## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Submit an [issue](https://github.com/framework7io/framework7/issues), assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git branch
    master/my_contribution master` then checkout the new branch with `git
    checkout master/my_contribution`. Better avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch, to avoid conflicts if you pull in updates from origin.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Use descriptive commit messages and reference the #issue number.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository

## Editor Config

The project uses .editorconfig to define the coding style of each file. We recommend that you install the Editor Config extension for your preferred IDE.


## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/framework7).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
